# Coding Task â€“ Data Feed

## Introduction
This is a command-line program built with Laravel Zero that processes an XML file and pushes the data to a database. The program is designed to be easily extendable and configurable, allowing different data storage options. It also includes error logging and testing capabilities.

```
php feed process:feed <your_file_path>
```

### Testing
To run the tests, make sure you have set up the testing database configuration in the `.env` file. Then, run the migration for testing database:
